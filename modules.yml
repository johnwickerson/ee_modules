  ilos:
    "1": design and analyse analogue circuits based on active elements
      (transistors/op-amps) considering non-ideal component behaviour
    "2": develop hierarchical models of more complicated circuits
    "3": analyse frequency response of transistor-based circuits, feedback and
      stability, and apply these to attain design objectives
