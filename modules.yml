  name: Digital Electronics and Computer Architecture
  ilos: 
    1: design significant synchronous sequential digital circuits using registers and combinational logic
    2: design simple twoâ€™s complement addition and subtraction digital circuits, with correct use of carry and overflow
    3: use digital blocks: RAMs, ROMs, registers, adders, multiplexers and state machines to design and analyse the operation of simple pipelined RISC computer systems
    4: model the operation of machine code instructions on a CPU at register-transfer level, and manipulate data using different numeric representations
    5: write programs for arithmetic operations, manipulating bit fields within words, accessing memory, and calling subroutines
    6: implement I/O in embedded computer systems using polling
